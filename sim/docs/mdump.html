<H3>Example program: mdump</H3>

<P>mdump is a simple memory editor that uses the hex keypad and
pixie graphic display. The code consumes less than 512 bytes and may be run
from PROM.
The program requires at least 2K of RAM
(RAM must extended beyond the program up to addess 07FF).
The video mode used is 64x128, in order to avoid excessive overhead
in the refresh interrupt routine thus allowing non-refresh
code a larger percentage of the CPU.
The characters displayed use a 64x64 style to make them less "squashed".

<P>The following operations are supported:
<UL>
<LI>Step forward one location.
<LI>Step backward one location.
<LI>Modify data at current address.
<LI>Modify current address.
<LI>Go to (execute) current address.
</UL>

<P>Detailed operation is as follows:
<DL>
<DT>Step forward one location</DT>
<DD>Press the IN button (with toggle switch "7" off).</DD>
<DT>Step backward one location</DT>
<DD>Press the IN button with toggle switch "7" on.</DD>
<DT>Modify data at current address</DT>
<DD>Press a key on the keypad (with toggle switch "0" off).
The current memory location is shifted left one digit and the
value of the pressed key is added. In other words:<BR>
<PRE>M(adr) = (M(adr) &lt;&lt; 4) | key</PRE>
</DD>
<DT>Modify current address</DT>
<DD>Press a key on the keypad with toggle switch "0" on.
The current address is shifted left one digit and the
value of the pressed key is added. In other words:<BR>
<PRE>adr = (adr &lt;&lt; 4) | key</PRE>
Note that, while entering an address, the current address
may temporarily be invalid and display memory that does not exist.
Once all four digits have been entered, the address should be complete.
</DD>
<DT>Go to current address</DT>
<DD>Press the IN button with toggle switch "1" on.
The current address is transferred to R(3) and P is set to 3.
The video chip is still active and R(0), R(1), and R(2) must
be preserved to allow proper operation. There seems to be no
way to disable the pixie chip programatically.

<P>The following properties will setup the simulator to run this program:
<PRE>
ram=2k
hexkeypad
pixie
prom=mdump.bin
</PRE>

<P>In addition, 'autorun' could be used to start the simulator in the RUN mode.
Also, "preload=mdump.bin" could be used instead of "prom=mdump.bin" to
cause the program to be loaded into RAM, and cause no PROM to be configured.
