<H3>COS/MAC ELF Pixie Graphics</H3>

<P>This program is a simple demo for the "Pixie" graphics add-on,
using the CDP1861 video generator chip
(as described in Popular Electronics).

<P>To run this, create a config file (plain text) that contains these lines:
<UL><PRE>pixie
prom = pixie1.bin</PRE></UL>

<P>Where "pixie1.bin" is the file in this repository under "progs/pixie1.bin".

<P>Then invoke the simulator with the command:
<UL><PRE>java -jar VirtualCOSMAC_ELF.jar &lt;config-file&gt;</PRE></UL>

<P>NOTE: This program is not able to run from ROM, especially on a 256-byte
RAM system. It will be necessary to transfer the ROM image into RAM.
Fortunately, the simulator provides a command to do that.

<P>Once the simulator starts, select the "Copy ROM to RAM" item in the "Debug" menu.
The switch off LOAD and switch on RUN. At this point,
an image should appear on the Pixie screen.

<P>NOTE: the simulator video timing is currently not close enough to original hardware
in order to be able to run 64x32 or 64x64 mode, which requires precise synchronization
between the CPU and the video chip.
