<H3>COS/MAC ELF Keypad test</H3>

<P>This program confirms proper operation of the hex keypad
(as described in Popular Electronics),
Using a CD4515 connected to N2.
See "progs/kptest.lst" for logic.

<P>To run this, create a config file (plain text) that contains this line:
<UL><PRE>hexkeypad
prom = kptest.bin</PRE></UL>

<P>Where "kptest.bin" is the file in this repository under "progs/kptest.bin".

<P>Then invoke the simulator with the command:
<UL><PRE>java -jar VirtualCOSMAC_ELF.jar &lt;config-file&gt;</PRE></UL>

<P>Once the simulator starts, click the PROM jumper to set it "on", then
switch off LOAD and switch on RUN. At this point, depressing a button
on the keypad should result in that hex value being displayed.
