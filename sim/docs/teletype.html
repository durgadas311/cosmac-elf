<H3>Glass Teletype Operation</H3>

<P>This serial port attachment is a "dumb terminal" modeled after
the ASR-33 Teletype.

<P>The paper tape reader uses text files on the host.
Hovering the mouse over the AUTO button will reveal the name of
the file currently mounted, or "EMPTY" if none.

<P>The paper tape punch also uses text files on the host.
Hovering the mouse over the TAPE button will reveal the name of
the file currently mounted, or "EMPTY" if none.

<P>The following menus and buttons are available:
<DL>
<DT>Tape</DT>
<DD>
	<DL>
	<DT>Reader</DT>
	<DD>Selects file to use as the paper tape reader data.
	Any currrent file is closed.
	Cancel leaves the device EMPTY.
	Re-selecting the same file again effectively "rewinds" the tape.
	</DD>
	<DT>Punch</DT>
	<DD>Selects file to use as the paper tape reader data.
	Any currrent file is closed.
	Cancel leaves the device EMPTY.</DD>
	</DL>
</DD>
<DT>Paper</DT>
<DD>
	<DL>
	<DT>Save</DT>
	<DD>Selects file to save the text contents of the window into.</DD>
	<DT>Tear Off</DT>
	<DD>Clears all text from the window, like rolling up and tearing off
	the paper on a teletype.</DD>
	</DL>
</DD>
<DT>START</DT>
<DD>Starts the paper tape reader, if a file was selected.
This is essentially the same as the computer sending a ^Q (DC1) character
with the reader in AUTO mode.</DD>
<DT>AUTO</DT>
<DD>Sets the paper tape reader in AUTO mode, if a file was selected.
This allows the reader to respond ^Q (DC1) and ^S (DC3) characters from the
computer.
</DD>
<DT>STOP</DT>
<DD>Manually stops the paper tape reader.
This also cancels AUTO mode, preventing the reader from responding
to control characters from the computer.
</DD>
<DT>TAPE</DT>
<DD>Turns on the paper tape punch, if a file was selected.
This is essentially the same as the computer sending a ^R (DC2) character.</DD>
<DT>(TAPE)</DT>
<DD>Turns off the paper tape punch.
This is essentially the same as the computer sending a ^T (DC4) character.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Properties are:
<DL>
<DT>teletype_eol_delay</DT>
<DD>A delay to be added after LF for paper tape.
This should only be needed if the paper tape file does not contain NULs.
Units are milliseconds.
A good working value seems to be 200 (for Tiny BASIC, at least).
Default is "0" - no delay.
</DD>
<DT>teletype_reader</DT>
<DD>A file to be initially mounted on the paper tape reader.
This file may be changed later, using the menus.
The reader is left in the STOP mode.
</DD>
<DT>teletype_auto</DT>
<DD>Starts up with the reader in AUTO mode.</DD>
<DT>teletype_punch</DT>
<DD>A file to be initially mounted on the paper tape punch.
This file will be overwritten, so typically the file should not exist when starting.
This file may be changed later, using the menus.
</DD>
