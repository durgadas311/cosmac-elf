<H3>CDP1854 UART Configuration</H3>

<P>This device emulates the CDP1854 UART chip.
The property "cdp1854=<I>dev</I>" is used to enable the device.
The value of this property is used as the device mnemonic,
and defaults to "tty".

<P>Note that this device requires iodecoder=strict and consumes
two adjacent ports based on N0. The Tx/Rx data ports are at N0=0
and the status/control ports are at N0=1.

<P>The following additional properties configure the UART,
using the device mnemonic string chosen above.

<DT><I>dev</I>_port</DT>
<DD>Define the I/O device number base,
the values of N0,N1,N2 that will select this device.
See notes above.
Default is none: device is inaccessible.</DD>

<DT><I>dev</I>_clock</DT>
<DD>Define the serial clock rate.
Note that this clock rate is 16x the baud.
Default is 153600, which is 9600 baud.
This value is used to simulate timing to the CDP1802
program, and does not affect the interaction with attached
peripheral devices.

<DT><I>dev</I>_att</DT>
<DD>Define what is attached to the UART.
Must match a JAVA class that is built-in to the JAR.
Classes available:
  <DL>
  <DT>TeletypeSerial</DT>
  <DD>A very simple scrolling text window.

  </DD>
  <DT>TelnetSerial ip-addr port</DT>
  <DD>A telnet (TCP/IP socket) connection at IP address and port.
