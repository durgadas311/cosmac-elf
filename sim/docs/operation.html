<H3>Simulator Operation</H3>

The simulator features are operated from the menu bar.
The following menu items are available:

<H4>Debug</H4>

<DL>

<DT>Trace (custom)</DT>
<DD>Pops up a dialog for tracing the CPU execution of instructions.
Trace output is sent to stderr or the "log" file.
Tracing may be canceled with the "Trace OFF" menu item.
Tracing is also canceled by changing the tracing parameters.
</DD>

<DT>Trace ON</DT>
<DD>Turns tracing on immediately, flooding the log/stderr with
trace lines.
Tracing may be canceled with the "Trace OFF" menu item.
</DD>

<DT>Trace OFF</DT>
<DD>Cancels any tracing currently enabled.
</DD>

<DT>Dump To Log/GUI</DT>
<DD>Alternates between dumping data to log file (stderr) or
pop-up windows. This does not affect tracing output.
</DD>

<DT>Dump CPU</DT>
<DD>Dumps information about the CPU state.
</DD>

<DT>Dump Machine</DT>
<DD>Dumps information about the platform.
</DD>

<DT>Dump Core</DT>
<DD>Dumps the contents of RAM to a file.
</DD>

<DT>Load Prog</DT>
<DD>Fills RAM with the contents of a file.
</DD>

<DT>Dump Page</DT>
<DD>Dumps a 256-byte page of the CPU address space
(ROM or RAM as appropriate).
</DD>

<DT>Disassemble</DT>
<DD>Dumps disassembled instructions from a range page of the CPU address space.
</DD>

<DT>Copy ROM to RAM</DT>
<DD>Copys the contents of the PROM into RAM. Does not require the PROM to be
enabled (via jumper plug). This is essentially the same as "Load Prog"
where the selected file is the one specified by the "prom" property.
</DD>

<DT>Dump ELF-FP</DT>
<DD>Dumps information about the standard ELF front panel hardware.
</DD>

<DT>Dump HEXKEYPAD</DT>
<DD>Dumps information about the hexadecimal keypad.
Menu item does not exist if keypad is not installed.
</DD>

<DT>Dump PIXIE</DT>
<DD>Dumps information about the PIXIE graphic display hardware.
Menu item does not exist if pixie is not installed.
</DD>

<DT>Reset</DT>
<DD>Performs a hardware reset. This should be equivalent to setting
the RUN switch off.
</DD>

<DT>Quit</DT>
<DD>Ends the simulation. Clicking the "close" button on any of the
windows also ends the simulation.
</DD>
