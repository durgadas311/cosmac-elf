<H3>COS/MAC ELF Help</H3>

<P>Basic operation of simulator features is described <A HREF="operation.html">here</A>.

<P>The simulator is customized using properties that are specified by
"property=value" expressions.
These assignments may be in a plain-text file whose filename is
given on the command line (or assumed), and/or by assignments as command line arguments.
Details of properties are <A HREF="config.html">here</A>.

<P>Without a configuration file or properties, an ELF with 256 bytes of RAM is
created, with no optional hardware.

<P>Some examples, using programs provided in this repository, are:
