<H3>PIXIE Graphics Display Configuration</H3>

<P>The property "pixie" (value ignored)
adds the PIXIE graphic display to the simulation.
This emulates the CDP1861 video graphics chip.

<P>Note that this emulation counts CPU cycles in order to
produce the timing, and that CPU cycles are only reported
at the end of instructions. This means that the timing
will not be identical to the original chip, but should
meet software timing expectations.

<P>Also note that this device does not (currently)
force the CPU clock to a slower rate (e.g. 1.789MHz).
However, the timing is generated based on CPU cycles and not absolute
time references so the CPU clock setting is aribtrary
in that respect.
This device is not (currently) capable of operating at an independent clock rate.

<P>The following properties are recognized:
<DL>
<DT>pixie_color</DT>
<DD>Specify the screen color for the PIXIE graphic display.
Value is a 6-digit hexadecimal number representing RGB.
Default is green (00ff00).</DD>

<DT>pixie_port</DT>
<DD>Set the I/O port ('n' for "OUT n"/"IN n" instructions).
Default is 1 (using N0 signal).</DD>

<DT>pixie_disable</DT>
<DD>(value ignored) Allows for the CDP1861 to be disabled
using the OUT instruction at the selected port.
Only INP will enable the chip, if this option is selected.
</DD>

<DT>pixie_ef</DT>
<DD>Set the EF input for detecting frame refresh start/end.
Default is 1 (using EF1 signal).</DD>
