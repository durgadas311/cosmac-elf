<H3>Simulator Configuration</H3>

<P>The simulator is customized using a plain-text configuration file.
This file contains "property=value" lines which define the simulator
configuration. The configuration file is searched in the following order:

<OL>
<LI>File name specified on the JAVA command
<LI>File name in environment variable "COSMACELF_CFG"
<LI>"./cosmac_elf.rc"
<LI>"$HOME/.cosmac_elfrc"
</OL>

<P>Any properties given on the command line will
override those in a configuration file.
Command line properties must include an equals sign ('=')
in order to be recognized, regardless of whether the property
value is used/required.

<P>The following properties are recognized:

<DL>

<DT>log</DT>
<DD>Specifies a file to be used for simulator (debug) output.
Default is to send all output to stderr. Adding a "a" after
the file name causes the previous file contents to be preserved,
otherwise the file is truncated each time the simulator starts.</DD>

<DT>ram</DT>
<DD>Specifies the size of RAM. RAM starts at 0000h, but may
be overlayed with PROM. Value must be a power of two.
A suffix of "k" may be used to multiply by 1024.
Default is 256 bytes.</DD>

<DT>prom</DT>
<DD>Specifies the file containing an image to be used for PROM.
This image will be expanded to the next power of two in size.
This property causes the base ELF to include jumper pins
under the hex displays. Clicking on the jumper pins will
install (or remove) a jumper plug on the pins. When plug is installed,
PROM is enabled and overlays RAM at 0000h. Note, there must be
more RAM than ROM, if RAM is required. RAM "underneath" the PROM
is not accessible.</DD>

<DT>hexkeypad</DT>
<DD>(value ignored) Add the hexadecimal keypad to the simulation.</DD>

<DT>pixie</DT>
<DD>(value ignored) Add the PIXIE graphic display to the simulation.</DD>

<DT>pixie_color</DT>
<DD>Specify the screen color for the PIXIE graphic display.
Value is a 6-digit hexadecimal number representing RGB.
Default is green (00ff00).</DD>
