<H3>TMSI Tiny BASIC Demo</H3>

<P>A copy of TMSI Tiny BASIC is in progs/tiny_basic/tb0_test.bin.
<A HREF="http://www.cosmacelf.com/software/">TMSI Tiny BASIC is discussed here</A>,
and can be
<A HREF="https://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/mship_tbasic.html">obtained here</A>.

<P>The following configuration may be used to run it:
<PRE>
ram = 64k
quart
quart_att = TeletypeSerial
quart_qmark=0
quart_efmark=0
preload = tb0_test.bin
autorun
</PRE>

<P>The version "tb0_test.bin" is hard-coded to 1200 baud and will run
an embedded test program when started. If loaded into RAM ("preload" property)
then it is possible to type "NEW" and enter other programs.

<P>If you compile tb0_test.asm with "AUTORUN EQU 0", then the test
program is not included and you will need to press CR
(carriage return - i.e. ENTER on modern keyboards)
in order to let Tiny BASIC calculate the serial baud rate and start.
It will then prompt "NEW?" at which point you should enter "Y" (CR).
A few seconds later you will get the ":" prompt.

<P>See the documentation at these URLs for information on how to run Tiny BASIC.
