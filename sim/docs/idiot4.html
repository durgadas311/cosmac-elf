<H3>IDIOT/4 Monitor Demo</H3>

<P>IDIOT/4 is a CDP1802 Monitor program that works on many ELF-style
computers.
<A HREF="http://www.cosmacelf.com/software/">IDIOT/4 is discussed here</A>.
The versions in progs/idiot4/ are identical to the latest from
<A HREF="https://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/mship_idiot.html">those located here</A>,
except that they are compiled to run at location 0000.
The demo uses progs/idiot4/idiotX0.bin, which matches the default
configuration of the simulator serial port.

<P>The following configuration may be used to run it:
<PRE>
ram = 64k
quart
quart_att = "TelnetSerial 192.168.0.0 12345"
preload = idiotX0.bin
autorun
</PRE>

<P>Replace "192.168.0.0" with the hostname or IP address of your system,
and replace "12345" with your favorite port number.
Once the simulator has been started, you may connect to the IP and port
using 'telnet' or your favorite program that supports telnet or TCP/IP socket connections.
<P>Whatever program you use to connect needs to run in a "raw" or "character" mode,
to avoid lines getting buffered and CR being translated. For telnet, the command
"mode character" will suffice. This command may also be put in a ~/.telnetrc file
to avoid having to type it each time telnet is started.

<P>You will need to press CR (carriage return - i.e. ENTER on modern keyboards)
in order to let IDIOT/4 calculate the serial baud rate and start.

<P>See the documentation at these URLs for information on how to run IDIOT/4.
