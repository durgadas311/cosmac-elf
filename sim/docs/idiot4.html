<H3>IDIOT/4 Monitor Demo</H3>

<P>IDIOT/4 is a CDP1802 Monitor program that works on many ELF-style
computers.
<A HREF="http://www.cosmacelf.com/software/">IDIOT/4 is discussed here</A>.
The versions in progs/idiot4/ are identical to the latest from
<A HREF="https://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/mship_idiot.html">those located here</A>,
except that they are compiled to run at location 0000.
The demo uses progs/idiot4/idiotX0.bin, which matches the default
configuration of the simulator serial port.

<P>The following configuration may be used to run it:
<PRE>
ram = 64k
quart
quart_att = TeletypeSerial
preload = idiotX0.bin
autorun
</PRE>

<P>You will need to press CR (carriage return - i.e. ENTER on modern keyboards)
in order to let IDIOT/4 calculate the serial baud rate and start.

<P>See the documentation at these URLs for information on how to run IDIOT/4.
