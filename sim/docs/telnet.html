<P>This serial port attachment is a TCP/IP socket connection,
compatible with telnet.

<P>The attachment syntax is:

<PRE>TelnetSerial <I>IP-addr</I> <I>port</I></PRE>

<P>Where <I>IP-addr</I> is the IP address or hostname of the system
running the simulator, and <I>port</I> is the TCP/IP port number
you want to listen on. This number must be between 3000-65535,
although some systems may allow numbers larger than 65535.

<P>When connecting with a terminal program (or 'telnet'),
you must specify the same <I>IP-addr</I> and <I>port</I>.
For example, the telnet command would be:

<PRE>telnet <I>IP-addr</I> <I>port</I></PRE>

<P>Note that the terminal program must use a "raw" mode,
or else you can get strange behavior due to line buffering and
possible translation of characters such and CR. For telnet,
the command would be "mode character". Other terminal programs
would have different methods for changing the mode.

<P>Telnet allows you to setup a "config file" to automatically
set the mode (or any other telnet commands) automatically.
By default, this file is "~/.telnetrc". For this example,
that file would contain:

<PRE>
<I>IP-addr</I>
        mode character
</PRE>
