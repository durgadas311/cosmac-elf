<H3>COS/MAC ELF Example 1</H3>

<P>This is the first example in the August 1976 Popular Electronics article.
It monitors the IN button and makes the Q LED follow the current state of
that switch.
<P>The program logic is:
<UL><PRE>START: REQ
LOOP:  BN4 START
       SEQ
       BR  LOOP
</PRE></UL>

<P>To run this, create a config file (plain text) that contains this line:
<UL><PRE>prom = example1.bin</PRE></UL>

<P>Where "example1.bin" is the file in this repository under "progs/example1.bin".

<P>Then invoke the simulator with the command:
<UL><PRE>java -jar VirtualCOSMAC_ELF.jar &lt;config-file&gt;</PRE></UL>

<P>Once the simulator starts, click the PROM jumper to set it "on", then
switch off LOAD and switch on RUN. At this point, depressing the IN button
should cause the Q LED to light, and releasing it should cause the LED to go dark.
