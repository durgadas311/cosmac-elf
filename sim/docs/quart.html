<H3>Q-UART Configuration</H3>

<P>The property "quart" (value ignored) will add the
Q-UART serial interface to the simulation.
This allows for using the Q output for RS232 Tx and one of the EF inputs
for RS232 Rx. Either one, or both (of Q and EFn), may be inverted with respect to the
RS232 MARK and SPACE line levels.

<P>The following properties are recognized:

<DL>

<DT>quart_ef</DT>
<DD>Set the EF input for receiving serial data.
Default is 3 (using EF3 signal).</DD>

<DT>quart_baud</DT>
<DD>Set the serial data data rate.
Default is 1200 baud.
Beware of using non-standard values or values greater than 1200.
This value is converted to the number of CPU clock cycles required for
one data bit.
Note that CPU instructions are neraly always 16 clock cycles,
and that Q and EFn can only be operated on instruction
boundaries and typically require multiple instructions
to process.
1200 baud is close the maximum workable bit rate for a 2MHz CPU.</DD>

<DT>quart_nbit</DT>
<DD>Number of data bits. Values between 5 and 8 are accepted.
Default is "8".
Parity is not currently supported.
STOP bits are not critical on receive, 3 are always sent.</DD>

<DT>quart_qmark</DT>
<DD>"0" or "1" to select which level on Q indicates RS232 "MARK".
Default is "1": Q "on" equates to RS232 MARK.</DD>

<DT>quart_efmark</DT>
<DD>"0" or "1" to select which level on EF indicates RS232 "MARK".
Default is "1": Q "on" equates to RS232 MARK.</DD>

<DT>quart_att</DT>
<DD>Define what is attached to the Q-UART serial port.
Must match a JAVA class that is built-in to the JAR.
Classes available:
  <DL>
  <DT>TeletypeSerial</DT>
  <DD>A very simple scrolling text window.
      For operating instructions <A HREF="teletype.html">click here</A>.
  </DD>
  <DT>TelnetSerial ip-addr port</DT>
  <DD>A telnet (TCP/IP socket) connection at IP address and port.
      For operating instructions <A HREF="telnet.html">click here</A>.
  </DD>
  </DL>
